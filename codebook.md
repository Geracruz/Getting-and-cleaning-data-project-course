Experimental design:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 

Raw data: The datasets used are "features", "activity labels", "subject_test", "x_train", "y_train", "subject_test", "x_test", "y_test".

Processed data: The variables name of x_train and x_test come from the features dataset, y_train and y_test contains the activity in a variable coded from 1:6, this was changed by the name of the activity, a new variable was created called type to distinguish between data from test and train in the definitive dataset.
